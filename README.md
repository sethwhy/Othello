# Othello
Play a fun game of Othello (Reversi) against an AI or a Friend locally

## Intended Project

This started off as an in class small assignment that  what just demonstrating the lengths of what code can do. I decided to take it upon myself and finish the implementation outside of class hours and get help for the artificial intelligence side, while also working fullstack for several portions of this code solo.

## Othello should include

- Customizable board and piece color (See color.h for shades and modify your desired ones at the top of othello.cc in the void Othello::display_status() const function)
- AI and Local play
- Commented code/Instructions
